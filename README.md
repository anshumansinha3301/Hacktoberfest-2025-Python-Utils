# SecurePy Check: Password Strength Evaluator

**Repository Name Suggestion:** `Hacktoberfest-2025-Python-Utils`

**SecurePy Check** is a simple, command-line utility written in Python that evaluates the strength of a user-provided password based on common security criteria like length, complexity, and character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols).

This project is specifically designed to be **beginner-friendly** and is an excellent starting point for new contributors participating in **Hacktoberfest 2025!**

## âœ¨ Features

* **Secure Input:** Uses the `getpass` module to hide password input in the terminal.

* **Detailed Feedback:** Provides a score and a list of specific checks (e.g., missing digits, good length).

* **Colorized Output:** Uses ANSI escape codes for visually clear results (Strong, Moderate, Weak).

* **Portable:** Single file, zero dependencies outside of the Python standard library.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need Python 3.6 or newer installed on your system.

### Installation & Usage

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Hacktoberfest-2025-Python-Utils.git
cd Hacktoberfest-2025-Python-Utils

**Run the Script:**

python password_checker.py

### Easy Contribution Ideas (Great for First PRs!):

1. **Enhance Feedback Messages:** Improve the clarity or friendliness of the `feedback` strings in `check_password_strength`.

2. **Add a New Criteria:** Implement a check for a new rule (e.g., checking for common dictionary words or consecutive characters).

3. **Add Unit Tests:** Write simple tests using Python's built-in `unittest` module to verify the scoring logic.

4. **Refactor Scoring:** Suggest and implement a more granular or weighted scoring system.

5. **Documentation:** Improve comments, type hinting, or update this README.
